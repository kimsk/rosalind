-- This solution builds tree of substrings. Each node in the tree
-- has a flag to indicate whether the node has been visited, and a map whose keys
-- are the characters that can follow after the substring at this point in the tree
-- and whose values are subtrees.
--
-- We create the initial tree using the tails function and add each substring
-- to the tree. Then, for each successive DNA string, we only need to add the tails for
-- each string, because it will only add each tail as long as it matches what is already
-- in the tree.
--
-- After adding the tails of a DNA string, we prune the tree by removing all nodes that
-- were not visited while adding the DNA tails. This removes any parts of the tree that
-- aren't common substrings, so after each pruning the tree represents exactly the common
-- substrings of the DNA strings added so far.
--
-- Finally, we just look for the longest substring in the tree
